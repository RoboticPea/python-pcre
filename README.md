python-pcre
===========

Python bindings for PCRE regex engine.


Requirements
------------

* PCRE 8.30

So far tested with Python 2.7 only.


Building
--------

TBD


Installation
------------

Differences between python-pcre and re modules
----------------------------------------------

* slightly different regex syntax
* `sub()`, `subn()`, `expand()` use `str.format()` instead of `\1`
* returned group names are always unicode strings
* `DEBUG`, `LOCALE`, `VERBOSE` flags are not supported
* pattern caching is not supported

### Substitution example

```python
>>> pcre.sub(r'def\s+([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*)\s*\(\s*\):',
...          'static PyObject*\npy_{1}(void)\n{{',
...          'def myfunc():')
'static PyObject*\npy_myfunc(void)\n{'
```
Notice the `{1}` and escaped `{{` in repl string.

The built-in re module would use `\1` and a raw string instead:
`r'static PyObject*\npy_\1(void)\n{'`

The arguments used in `str.format()` call are:
* all groups starting from 0 (entire match) as positional arguments,
* all named groups as keyword arguments.
